## Phase 1: ML Foundations (Weeks 1–4)

### Week 1: Python & Data Manipulation
- Learn/revise Python basics (functions, loops, OOP)
- Explore NumPy & Pandas (arrays, dataframes)
- Learn data visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)

**Mini Project:** Titanic Dataset EDA (Kaggle)

### Week 2: ML Basics (Scikit-learn)
- Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- Regression & Classification Algorithms (Linear, Logistic, Decision Trees)
- Train-test split, cross-validation, accuracy, confusion matrix

**Mini Project:** Iris Classification using sklearn

### Week 3: Data Preprocessing + Feature Engineering
- Handling missing values, outliers, categorical encoding
- Feature scaling, transformation

**Mini Project:** House Price Prediction

### Week 4: Model Tuning + Intro to APIs
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Building simple ML model APIs using FastAPI/Flask

**Mini Project:** ML model served via FastAPI

---

## Phase 2: DevOps Basics (Weeks 5–8)

### Week 5: Git, GitHub, Docker
- Git CLI basics (clone, branch, push, merge)
- Create GitHub repo for projects
- Learn Docker basics: images, containers, Dockerfile

**Mini Project:** Dockerize Titanic ML API

### Week 6: CI/CD
- GitHub Actions: automated test + build pipeline
- Create simple `.yml` workflow for auto-testing model

**Mini Project:** Deploy model to Heroku/Render with CI/CD

### Week 7: Linux & Bash
- Navigating file systems, shell scripting basics
- Automate data downloads, model training

### Week 8: FastAPI Deep Dive
- Middleware, Routing, Dependency Injection, Swagger UI
- Auth & logging in ML APIs

---

## Phase 3: Real MLOps Stack (Weeks 9–12)

### Week 9: MLflow for Experiment Tracking
- Log models, parameters, metrics
- Run experiments and compare versions

**Mini Project:** ML pipeline using MLflow with tracking

### Week 10: DVC (Data Version Control)
- Setup remote storage (Google Drive / S3)
- Track changes to data, train model using stages

**Mini Project:** End-to-end pipeline with DVC stages

### Week 11: Cloud Deployments
- AWS EC2 + S3 basics
- Deploy Dockerized model to EC2

### Week 12: Monitoring & Logging
- Basic Prometheus + Grafana dashboard
- Log model latency, errors, usage

**Mini Project:** Full ML pipeline with tracking + monitoring on cloud

---

## Bonus Phase: Deep Learning & Scaling (Optional)

### Week 13+: DL Intro & GPU Deployment
- Learn PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Train CNN on image dataset
- Serve model via FastAPI + deploy on GPU-enabled server
